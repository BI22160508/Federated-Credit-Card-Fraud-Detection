# Federated Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a federated learning framework for credit card fraud detection,
focusing on privacy preservation, non-IID data, and communication-efficient training.

## Key Features
- Federated vs Centralized comparison
- Non-IID client partitioning
- Differential Privacy (DP)
- Top-K sparsification
- Evaluation using Recall, FNR, FPR, AUC

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy / Pandas
- Scikit-learn / PyTorch (if used)
- Federated Learning simulation

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Prepare dataset (see Dataset section)
3. Run experiment scripts
